# Benchgraph

Easily visualisation of the evolution of your benchmarks.

## Wat's benchgraph?

`Benchgraph` is a tool which helps you to see how your benchmarks evolve
through the lifetime of your program.

## Why do I need it

Wants to see if a new feature will slow your library down?
Wants to know why your users complains that your program starts getting slower?
That's what `Benchgraph` is for.

## Enough jabbing, I want nice pictures and buzzwords

All right, all righ.
